This is the code for the percs website.

It is an application, developed under the web2py framework (http://web2py.com).
Only using a very small set of the framework's capabilities for now.

Once you have that installed, add / link the contents of this directory as one of the web2py instance's
applications.

eg.
If the web2py server is installed here: 

    /var/web2py

You'll need to do something like:

    ln -s /var/web2py/applications/percs [PATH TO percs/website folder]

or create the web2py/applications/percs subdirectory, and unpack the files there as you see fit.

Then also set up the web2py server's routing rules.
You can do this with the main webserver, or web2py, or both...

In web2py, one way is to add a `routes.py` file in the web2py directory, with something like this inside:

routers = dict(

    # base router - send request for domain, to specific application.
    BASE=dict(
        domains = {
            'percs.otherchirps.net': 'percs'
        }
    ),

)
