About
=====

This is the code & project documentation for the `percs website`_.

Percs was initially created to provide a basic, searchable index of the `NSW Pecuniary interest documents`_.
These files are uploaded as large PDFs, containing scanned images of Minister's submissions.
Nearly 100 submissions, dumped into big, unsearchable, opaque files.

One `OpenAustralia`_ `pub meetup`_, Luke Bacon kicked off the effort by processing & splitting 
the files into `individual per-minister submissions`_.

Chris Nilsson ran these files through an OCR, indexed the found text, and wrapped this percs site around
the result. 

The aim is to digitise & index previous, and ongoing years as needed.  

Why? These folks are in charge of a good chunk of our money.  Having their
pecuniary interest declarations more accessible can only help keep
things transparent and fair.

Of course, the process isn't perfect.  Many documents are 
handwritten, and difficult enough for humans to read, letalone the OCR.

But, it's a start.
